<h1>About Me!</h1>
<hr>

<p>
  Growing up, I spent the vast majority of my time outdoors playing in the creek on our old ranch and fishing the pond that the creek fed into.
  As I got older my father started expanding my outdoor interests into hunting,
  which is a hobby I spend most of my free time doing and studying, as well as a life style I intend on spreading to my children.
  Ontop of this outdoor lifestyle, I also have a huge interest in video games and computers,
  this interest expanded my knowledge of computers and computer science, which is why I have started to move my career path into Computer Science.
