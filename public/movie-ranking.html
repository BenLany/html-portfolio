<h1>The Best Movies According to Bennett</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
    I love this movie because I am a huge space junkie.
    On top of that, the story telling and visuals are on a whole other level.

<h3>How to Train Your Dragon</h3>
<p>
    How to Train your Dragon is the best animated film I have ever seen.
    The mix of emotion, world building and story telling is top tier.

<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>
    Avatar was released in 2009 and yet some how still has some of the best CGI that has ever been seen in cinema.
    On top of that, it contains a deep lore and about the world and lots of emotions.
